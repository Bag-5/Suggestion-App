Description:
The Suggestion App is a platform designed for students at a tertiary institution to anonymously share feedback or suggestions with school administrators. The app ensures that students can voice their opinions privately, allowing only the admin to view the suggestions, while keeping all users' identities hidden from each other. This helps improve transparency and encourage open communication within the institution.

Features:

Anonymous Suggestions: Students can submit feedback without revealing their identity to other users.
Admin Access: Only administrators can view the names and suggestions submitted.
Secure Storage: All suggestions are securely stored, ensuring privacy and data protection.
